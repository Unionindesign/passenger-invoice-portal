# passenger-invoice-portal

Developed to simulate a client-side portal for invoicing, this app uses a MySQL database and Sequelize ORM to make calls to the database, populating passenger data with the goal of being able to apply and split discounts. While this original version uses Bootstrap and jQuery, I've started rebuilding the application in AngularJS.

You can preview the application, deployed on Heroku: https://obscure-mesa-57794.herokuapp.com/
